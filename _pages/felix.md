# About

Hey! I'm Felix, a postdoctoral researcher in the [Security and Trust of Software Systems (SaToSS) group](https://satoss.uni.lu/) led by [Sjouke Mauw](https://satoss.uni.lu/members/sjouke/) at the [University of Luxembourg](https://www.uni.lu/en/).
My research focuses on formal methods for security and software verification, with applications to security protocols and message-passing programs.

If you are curious about details, the [Research](/research) section is the place to go for publications and the [Software](/software) section gives an overview of software projects.

Prior, I was a PhD student at the [Max Planck Institute for Software Systems](https://www.mpi-sws.org/), <nobr>co-advised</nobr> by [Rupak Majumdar](https://people.mpi-sws.org/~rupak/) and [Damien Zufferey](https://dzufferey.github.io/).
For my PhD, I worked on analysis of message-passing programs.
These consist of a collection of processes which interact exclusively by exchanging messages asynchronously.
We devised algorithms to check that such programs behave as they should.
In 2022, I spent half a year with [Nikos Vasilakis](https://nikos.vasilak.is/) at [<nobr>MIT CSAIL</nobr>](https://www.csail.mit.edu/) working on the shell script parallelization framework [PaSh](https://binpa.sh/).

Even earlier, I got a Masters degree from [University of Saarland](https://saarland-informatics-campus.de/en/) and <nobr>I did</nobr> a half-year research internship at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/computing) with [Emanuele D'Osualdo](https://www.emanueledosualdo.com/) and [Philippa Gardner](https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~pg/).

If something piques your interest and you would like to chat, just send me a message!
